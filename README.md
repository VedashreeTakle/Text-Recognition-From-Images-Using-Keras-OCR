# Image Prediction with Machine Learning

This project implements an image prediction pipeline using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). It focuses on classifying input images into predefined categories while ensuring accuracy and efficient processing.


## Features

-Utilizes pre-trained CNN models such as VGG16, ResNet, or Inception for feature extraction.

-Handles image data preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

-Supports batch processing of images for scalability.

-Provides clear metrics for evaluation such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

-Development Process


## The project involves:

--Preprocessing image datasets (resizing, normalizing, and augmenting).

--Training a CNN model on labeled image data.

--Evaluating model performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.

--Visualizing training progress with loss and accuracy graphs.

--Making predictions on unseen images.


## Key Tools and Libraries

**Programming Language**: Python

**Libraries**:

~TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

~NumPy and Pandas

~Matplotlib and Seaborn

~Pillow

~Scikit-learn


## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:


## Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/image-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

```cd image-prediction```

Install the required dependencies:

```pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn Pillow seaborn```

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```jupyter notebook ImagePred.ipynb```


## Dataset

The dataset should consist of labeled images organized into subfolders where each folder represents a class label:

/dataset/

  /class1/
  
    image1.jpg
    
    image2.jpg
    
  /class2/
  
    image3.jpg
    
    image4.jpg


## Results

->**Accuracy**: Measures the correctness of predictions.

->**Confusion Matrix**: Shows true vs. predicted labels.

->**Training Graphs**: Tracks model progress over epochs.

->Sample predictions on test images.


## Future Enhancements

>> Experiment with deeper models or transfer learning for better accuracy.

>> Deploy the model using Flask or Django for real-time predictions.

>> Expand dataset diversity for improved generalization.
